Certainly! Let's break down the concept of content projection in Angular using `ng-content` and how you can use it to pass different content (like headers and footers) to a child component (`product-list` in this case).

### Scenario:
You have a main component that needs to display multiple product lists, each with a different heading and possibly other content like footers. Instead of creating multiple components or hardcoding the content, you can use Angular's content projection to pass the content dynamically.

### Main Component (Parent Component)
In your main component, you want to use the `product-list` component multiple times, each time passing different content for the header and footer.

```html
<!-- main.component.html -->
<product-list>
  <div slot="header">This is the first header</div>
  <div slot="footer">This is the first footer</div>
</product-list>

<product-list>
  <div slot="header">This is the second header</div>
  <div slot="footer">This is the second footer</div>
</product-list>
```

### Product List Component (Child Component)
In the `product-list` component, you will use `ng-content` to project the content passed from the parent component.

```html
<!-- product-list.component.html -->
<div class="product-list">
  <!-- Project the header content -->
  <ng-content select="[slot='header']"></ng-content>

  <!-- Your product list content goes here -->
  <ul>
    <li>Product 1</li>
    <li>Product 2</li>
    <li>Product 3</li>
  </ul>

  <!-- Project the footer content -->
  <ng-content select="[slot='footer']"></ng-content>
</div>
```

### Explanation:
1. **Content Projection (`ng-content`)**:
   - The `ng-content` element is a placeholder that Angular uses to insert the projected content.
   - The `select` attribute in `ng-content` is used to specify which content should be projected. In this case, it selects content based on the `slot` attribute.

2. **Slots**:
   - In the parent component, you define different slots (`header` and `footer`) using the `slot` attribute.
   - These slots are then projected into the corresponding `ng-content` placeholders in the child component.

3. **Reusability**:
   - By using content projection, you can reuse the `product-list` component multiple times with different headers and footers without modifying the child component itself.

### Final Output:
When the application runs, the `product-list` component will render the product list along with the projected header and footer content.

```html
<!-- Rendered output for the first product-list -->
<div class="product-list">
  <div slot="header">This is the first header</div>
  <ul>
    <li>Product 1</li>
    <li>Product 2</li>
    <li>Product 3</li>
  </ul>
  <div slot="footer">This is the first footer</div>
</div>

<!-- Rendered output for the second product-list -->
<div class="product-list">
  <div slot="header">This is the second header</div>
  <ul>
    <li>Product 1</li>
    <li>Product 2</li>
    <li>Product 3</li>
  </ul>
  <div slot="footer">This is the second footer</div>
</div>
```

### Summary:
- **Content Projection** allows you to pass content from a parent component to a child component.
- **`ng-content`** is used in the child component to project the passed content.
- **Slots** can be used to differentiate between different types of content (e.g., headers, footers).
- This approach makes your components more reusable and flexible.

This pattern is particularly useful when you want to create reusable components that can be customized with different content without modifying the component's internal structure.

All Lifecylce hooks
1)ngOnChanges 
2)ngOnInit()
3)ngDoCheck()
4)ngAfterContentInit
5)ngAfterContentChecked
6)ngAfterViewInit
7)ngAfterViewChecked
8)ngOnDestroy

=>As component used or loaded in any component then simply object of that will created
=>Then first consturctor will runs and then all next things will happen 
=>consturctor is not lifecycle hook or feature of angular it is just feature of typescript
=>From consturctor you cant access updated values of @Input, @ViewChild, @ViewChildren, @ContentChild, @ContentChildren
=>After consturctor ngOnChanges will call 
=>Before ngOnChages raise all values of @Input decorator will updated so you can access all updated values of @Input fields 
=>ngOnChanges will run for every change detection in @Input 
=>ngOnChanges takes one paramter names as SimpleChanges which have all information about previous state current state
=>After ngOnChages ngOnInit hook reaise 
=>ngOnInit triggers only once when first change detection runs
=>To use ngOnChages you can simply implements OnChages interface in corresponding class and for ngOnInit you can simply implement OnInit interface
=>After ngOnInit ngDocheck hook will trigger after first changes detection 
=>And then for every event occurs of change detection runs then ngDoCheck will trigger
=>ngAfterContentInit()=>This hook will raise after ngDoCheck after first change detection , It will run only once.Before this hook ng-content and ContentChild and ContentChildren is updated 
=>ngAfterContentChecked()=>This hook will trigger every time when there is change detection in ContentChild or ContentChildren
=>ngAfterViewInit()=>This will trigger only once and it will trigger after ngAfterContentChecked ,Before this event trigger all values of ViewChild and ViewChildren are updated ,here we can access updated values of 
=>ViewChild and ViewChildren
=>ngAfterViewChecked =>This will trigger every time when there is change detction in ViewChild or ViewChidren

ngDoCheck:

This hook is triggered every time Angular's change detection runs, regardless of whether there are actual changes or not.

It allows you to implement custom change detection logic.

Note: This hook runs frequently, so avoid heavy computations here to prevent performance issues.

ngAfterContentInit:

This hook is triggered once, after the first change detection cycle that involves content projection (ng-content).

It runs after Angular has projected external content (passed from the parent component via ng-content) into the child component.

At this point, ContentChild and ContentChildren queries are updated and can be accessed.

Key Point: This hook runs only once, after the initial content projection.

ngAfterContentChecked:

This hook is triggered after every change detection cycle that involves content projection (ng-content).

It runs after Angular has checked the content projected into the child component.

If there are changes in the content (e.g., updates to ContentChild or ContentChildren), this hook will be triggered.

Key Point: This hook runs frequently, after every change detection cycle involving content.

ngAfterViewInit:

This hook is triggered once, after Angular has fully initialized the component's view (including child views).

It runs after ngAfterContentChecked and after the view (including ViewChild and ViewChildren) has been fully initialized.

At this point, you can safely access and manipulate the DOM elements or values of ViewChild and ViewChildren.

Key Point: This hook runs only once, after the view is fully initialized.

ngAfterViewChecked:

This hook is triggered after every change detection cycle that involves the component's view.

It runs after Angular has checked the component's view and its child views.

If there are changes in the view (e.g., updates to ViewChild or ViewChildren), this hook will be triggered.

Key Point: This hook runs frequently, after every change detection cycle involving the view.
